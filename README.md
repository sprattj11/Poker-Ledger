# Poker-Ledger

# Description:
A poker ledger is created from a .csv file that is based on the poker game. A ledger is used to minimize the amount of transactions per player, rather than sending money to "buy-in" and "buy-out" a winners earnings are subtracted by their buy-in amount.

# How To Use:
Download the ledger csv file from the PokerNow lobby once the game has finished. Place the ledger csv file into the same directory as the main.py file. Rename the .csv file into 'ledger.csv'. Run the main.py script.

# Output:
The output will be the poker ledger copied to the machine's clipboard. This can be used to paste into the PokerNow chat, or a seperate chat with all players.
